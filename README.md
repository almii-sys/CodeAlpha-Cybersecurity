## Projects Overview

### Task 1: Network Sniffer

A Python-based network packet sniffer built using the **Scapy** library. This tool captures live network traffic, analyzes each packet, and displays critical information such as:

- Source IP address
- Destination IP address
- Protocol type (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP)

This project helped me understand how data flows through networks, the structure of network packets, and the basics of protocol analysis.

- How to recognize phishing emails and fake websites
- Common social engineering tactics used by attackers
- Best practices to avoid falling victim to phishing
- Real-world examples with interactive quizzes for user engagement

Technologies used include **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to create a colorful, user-friendly learning experience.
